-- We'll need a ''real" online version that's not hosted on a machine
in my flat so it would be great if you could set up a system on the
amazon infrastructure that Barquin kindly sponsors in early September.
It doesn't need to be bulletproof.

-- I'll add http://easyrec.org/recommendation-engine to the fragment
detail view to log what fragments are viewed by users but this is a
trivial issue. I'm using this over at http://theyshootmusic.at and
it's a neat out-of-the-box thing that works well.

-- The fragment and the creation detail view will be changed but this
should only cover the view layer. A useful thing would be a list to
nearby (space) fragments; that's the only thing I currently can think
of that's not a view problem.

-- Maybe we can work out something after your holidays to clean up the
timemap component from an aesthetical point of view. I will discuss
this with Eduard from k-lab and realize there's not much that can be
changed easily.

-- simple role & lifecycle system
