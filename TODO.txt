Major:

- mxnDraw
- mapstraction type selection (OSM, Google, Bing, Nokia) https://dl.dropbox.com/u/26153001/Mapping%20Literature/Nav_Mapstraction_Dropdown.png
- search/sort authors/genres
- Alternative/new (mobile) front page view

Minor points are
- We're going for the Arvo & PT Sans font choice
( http://designshack.net/articles/css/10-great-google-font-combinations-you-can-copy/
)
- The "update circles" at the front page should be replaced by the
arrows as ~seen in the front-page.rar . The js hooks are already
there. It would be a nifty visual support feature for new users to
realize what component is triggering what. You were right the
table->map feature is a good idea.
- If easy to apply an img upload feature for creation (book cover)
would be great.

To be tested / works for me:

- The "meta" search@nav isn't working. It should search authors,
creations and labelled anchors
- The table search@front page is out of order
- Author Index view is broken
- The timemap component doesn't need to display creations in the
century scale. ( It also seems to lead to 'glitching' layers when
using the interface )
- When using table-sort the title vanishes (@front-page)
- Adding an autocomplete field for fragments for adding labeled anchors
- The Anchor Index View should only list labeled anchors.
( https://dl.dropbox.com/u/26153001/Mapping%20Literature/Anchor_Index_View.png )
- search/sort/map filter on anchors index
- use of twitter tab-thing to show of the text-content of fragments
within creation detail view (order by starting page number)
- Autocomplete fields instead of drowdown boxes
- For Creation first_published_at & published_at no day is needed.   Note that the date format is now specified in app.en.yml
